ARMONK, New York-  04 Feb 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a broad expansion of its Cloud Data Services portfolio with more than 25 services now available on the IBM Cloud. They are designed to help developers build, deploy and manage web and mobile applications and enable data scientists to discover hidden trends using data and analytics in the cloud. The hybrid cloud services can be deployed across multiple cloud providers and are based on open source technologies, open ecosystems that include company and third-party data, and open architectures that allows data to easily flow amongst the different services. In addition to self-service capabilities for everything from data preparation, migration, and integration, to tools for advanced data exploration and modeling, IBM introduced the following new cloud data services today:IBM Compose Enterprise: A managed platform designed to help development teams build modern web-scale apps faster by enabling them to deploy business-ready open source databases in minutes on their own dedicated cloud servers.IBM Graph: The first fully managed graph database service built on Apache® TinkerPop that provides developers a complete stack to extend business-ready apps with real-time recommendations, fraud detection, IoT and network analysis uses.IBM Predictive Analytics: A service that allows developers to easily self-build machine learning models from a broad library into applications to help deliver predictions for specific product use cases, without the help of a data scientist.IBM Analytics Exchange: An open data exchange that includes a catalog of more than 150 publicly available datasets that can be used for analysis or integrated into applications.“Data is the common thread within the enterprise, regardless of where its source might be. In the past, data handlers have relied on disparate systems for data needs, but our goal is to move data into the future by providing a one-stop shop to access, build, develop and explore data,” said Derek Schoettle, General Manager, Analytics Platform and Cloud Data Services. “IBM’s integrated Cloud Data Services give developers greater scalability and flexibility to build, deploy and manage web and mobile cloud applications, and enable data scientists to apply information across businesses efficiently."IBM Graph delivers the only enterprise-grade graph database as a service, built on Apache TinkerPop, the leading open source graph technology stack. Provided as a service, IBM Graph helps remove the complexities traditionally associated with moving data from existing databases to graph architectures. "It is good to see Apache TinkerPop and the Gremlin graph traversal language being adopted as the primary interface to IBM's Graph service," said Marko A. Rodriguez, Apache TinkerPop Project Management Committee member. "IBM was instrumental in pushing TinkerPop to join the Apache Software Foundation which is important because Apache provides a commercial-friendly license and a tried-and-true open source development model that has done wonders for TinkerPop's software and community. I hope other large enterprises follow IBM's decision to leverage Apache TinkerPop in their respective graph products and services."The new offerings build on IBM’s significant investment in Apache Spark and further complement its mission to provide enterprise class support for open source developers and data handlers of any level. IBM has redesigned more than 25 of the company’s core analytics and commerce solutions with Apache®Spark™- helping to dramatically accelerate their real-time processing capabilities.For more information on IBM’s Cloud Data Services portfolio, please visit: www.ibm.biz/open-for-data.For more information on IBM Analytics, please visit www.ibm.com/analytics.
